# Trial 1: The Broken React App

Throughout this trial, you have a golden opportunity to flex those problem solving muscles by using what you've learned to fix this React app!

The app, when finished, should display all of the elements stored in the apps state in their own nifty little components. When you have finished debugging you will have an app that looks like the image below.

Some of the problems will give you console logs, some will throw errors, while the majority of them will not provide any useful direction. You will need to develop a thoughtful approach to solving these types of problems.

Make sure to take your time to read and understand the code and challenge what you think you know about what the code is doing.

Follow the trail of information and fix this app!

Good luck!!!
